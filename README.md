# AlphaResearch_LC_Futures
This is a self-directed quant research project built on my real manual trades in Lithium Carbonate (LC) futures during Juneâ€“July 2024. The goal is to understand price behavior, test trading logic, and explore whether statistical models can support short-term trend strategies.
